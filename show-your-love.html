                Through our epistolary we tackle the really big questions:<br>
            </p>
            <p class="fade-in">
                <b>- What does a love letter to a city look like?</b><br>
                <b>- How can we show love?</b><br>
                <b>- What is love?</b>
            </p>
            <p class="fade-in">
                <em>&#127926; (Baby don't hurt me...)<br><br></em> 
            </p>
            <p class="fade-in">
                Writing letters are a beautiful way of showing love, but it's certainly not the only way!</p>
            <p class="fade-in"> 
                So in this spirit we encourage you to not just write a note, but show your love through <em>action</em>. Consider how you can actively care for your city to design the world you want.
            </p>
            <p class="fade-in"> 
                It could be something as simple as:<br><br>
                
                - Picking up that discarded bottle on the street<br>
                - Getting to know your local barista<br>
                - Planting some native trees with a local club<br>
                - Filling up a little bird bath on your balcony on a hot day<br>
                - Buying your neighbour a beer... on a hot day<br><br>
            </p>
            <div class="fade-in">
                <hr width="90%"><br>
                Whatever you choose to do, do it with purpose.<br><br>
                <q><em>Love is the active concern for the life and the growth of that which we love.</em></q>
