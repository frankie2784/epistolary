                    The 'letters' on this site can come in many forms, not only written, and are as diverse as we hope they are thought-provoking.

                    You, too, can create and submit your own love letter to places you care about through our <a href="https://forms.gle/1tetwi6wH55oAMMNA" target="_blank">online portal</a>, and <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/a-lovers-discourse-write-a-love-letter-to-melbourne-tickets-132865082037" target="_blank">workshops</a> we are running during Melbourne Design Week 2021.<br><br>

                    Making your own letter to Melbourne should take around 10 minutes, although you may enjoy the process (or you may have a super awesome idea) and want to take longer.

                You will need:<br>

                Through our epistolary we tackle the really big questions:<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>...what does a love letter to a city look like?</b><br>
                <b>...how can we show love?</b><br>
                <b>...what is love?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>&#127926; (Baby don't hurt me...)<br><br></em> 
            </p>
            <p>
                Writing letters are a beautiful way of showing love, but it's certainly not the only way!</p>
            <p> 
                So in this spirit we encourage you to not just write a note, but show your love through <em>action</em>. Consider how you can actively care for your city to design the world you want.
