                Epistolary is a digital exhibition and self-guided tour of the city featuring a collection of love letters to Melbourne.
            <br><br>
                It launched as part of <a href="https://designweek.melbourne/events/epistolary/" target="_blank">Melbourne Design Week 2021</a>.</p>

                We created this project in response to the extended lockdown restrictions that the city experienced during 2020-21.
            <br><br>
                We wanted to find a way to help (re-)connect with and care for the places we love from afar &mdash; through memory, imagination and digital technology.

                    "What is an epistolary?", you ask, furrowing your brow as you sip your soy latte. We're glad you asked, fellow Melburnian.<br><br>
                    Put simply, an epistolary a collection of letters.
                    <br><br>
                    Epistolary writing (letter-writing) has long been seen as a way to gain insight into how we make sense of our place in the world.

                    Letters are special things that travel between people and places, often traversing the blurry territory between private and public. Through them we express our observations and uncertainties, fears and desires; and they are usually addressed to another person, who we hope will reciprocate &mdash; perhaps even with a letter of their own.
                </p>
            </div>

                    In this project, we are approaching the epistolary from a different angle. We are presenting love letters – which we so often cherish as one of our most private pasttimes – here in a very public forum. We are deliberately leaving the format of submitted letters open, allowing authors to express themselves in the way they know best. But rather than being addressed to another human, all the letters on this site are addressed to our beloved city.

                    <em>- What does a loved city look like?</em>
                    <br><br>
                    These are the questions at the heart of our epistolary.

He currently works at the intersection of data science, mapping, transport and public policy. The common thread? Admittedly very little. But he's had a lifelong fascination with the human condition, and is a sucker for that sense of pure, unadulterated wonder about the world that so many of us left somewhere back in our childhoods. He also likes making <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CKSUGoFFLfq/" target="_blank">pretty things</a>.
